This repository contains integrations of existing 3D viewers or reference implementations of 3D viewers for embedding in Kitodo.Presentation or DFG-Viewer.

## Installation

- Clone repository or download source code.
- Run the `install.sh` bash script to download libraries and frameworks under `modules` folder of each viewer implementation

After these steps, you will have a folder with the respective viewer integration, its dependencies and resources as well as the `dlf-3d-viewer.yml` configuration file required for the integration.

For more informations regarding embedding this folder into Kitodo.Presentation and DFG-Viewer, read the [Embedded 3D Viewer](https://kitodo.github.io/kitodo-presentation/Developers/Embedded3DViewer.html) documentation.

## Integrations

These are integrations of 3D viewers or custom 3D viewer implementations base on a JavaScript 3D library (e.g. three.js) which have been prepared for Kitodo.Presentation and thus for the DFG-Viewer.

*DLF prefix stands for “Digital Library Framework” and is the key of the TYPO3 extension “Kitodo.Presentation”. The name of the viewer integration can be chosen freely for your [custom viewer](https://kitodo.github.io/kitodo-presentation/Developers/Embedded3DViewer.html#Custom%20Viewer).*

### dlf-3dhop
